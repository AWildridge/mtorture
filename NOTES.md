* gen_mul.pl -- pass in function to call, eval it
* MatriplexSym -- in intrinsics use 64/sizeof(T) for loop increment
* comment out std sym mult code, leave intrinsics in
* add comments that show how the code was generated with gen_mul.pl
* test multiplication for 6x6 sym
* extend test so that other matriplex elements are also tested
   * will need set-to float* variant of Assign (Export ?)
